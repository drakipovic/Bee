# Bee

This project was part of my master's thesis, it uses machine learning techniques and tries to deanonymize source code authors based on programming style. Deanonymization means that algorithm has no idea who author of source code is, it tries to found out who wrote it based on some test data and programming style of author.

## Usage
> python bee.py -h
